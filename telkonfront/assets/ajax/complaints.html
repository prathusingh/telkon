        	Managing records in <strong>registers</strong> has become obsolete these days. Its really difficult to maintain data, search a record, making changes or correction in a record, tracking a record etc, with this traditional approach. <br>
        	In todays world, almost everything has gone online like booking travel tickets, ordering food, calling cab, paying utilities etc. Theres gotta be a reason for this. And the reason is quite simple - </strong>better &amp efficient management</strong> and  <strong>User-friendly</strong>. <br> <br>
        	<strong>Telkon</strong> offers <strong>Online Complaint Management System</strong> for managing the societies' complaints in a better way by showing the actions taken on a complaint in a <strong>timeline fashion</strong>. The complaints are accessible to the complainants as well. They can track the complaint online and raise request for escalation, if necessary.
