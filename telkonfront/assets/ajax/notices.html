        	Most of us do not get time to carry out any philanthropical activity or to work for some NGO or do any other social work that could make us feel better i.e. to contribute towards the society at individual level. But now, we can. <br>
        	Most of the societies use <strong>notice</strong> as a medium of communication with the residents. Although, notice boards remain filled with notices throughout the year, very few people get a chance to look at it and hardly anyone goes through all of them. If these notices are not reaching to its audience, there is no point using such a medium which uses a lot papers and still, does not solve the purpose. <br> <br>
        	<strong>Telkon</strong> provides an easy-to-use and user-friendly feature called <strong>Online Notice Board</strong>. Now, the residents can read the notices anytime they want, from anywhere they want and also, they can save it for future read or reference.Also, think about the paper that we could save by adopting this way.
