        	Isn't it annoying not to find a single contact of a <strong>service provider</strong> like electrician, plumber, carpenter, cook, maid etc at the time when we need it the most? Well, not any more. <br> <br>
        	<strong>Telkon</strong> maintains a list of important contacts of service providers in your locality. Also, the society admins have been provided with an interface to share <strong>RWA/Association</strong> and <strong>Intercom</strong> numbers with residents so that the residents can reach out to them easliy.
